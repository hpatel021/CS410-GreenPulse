        <h2>Societal Problem</h2>
        <p>With the climate being in as terrible of a state that it is currently, 
            making active choices to lessen our effect on the environment is becoming 
            more and more important each day. The lack of knowledge of what options 
            are more eco-friendly to the general population is the issue. 

            A large amount of society wants to be more eco-conscious. 
            Recent surveys have observed that over 85% of participants have made 
            changes in the last 5 years to their purchase habits 
            (Global Sustainability Study 2021: Initial insights).
